# SuperFomus

SuperCollider bindings to Fomus Music Notation (FOrmat MUSic).

``FOMUS is a open source software that automates many musical notation tasks for composers and musicians [...] Once the composer loads or inputs their materials, FOMUS outputs a file suitable for importing into a graphical notation program such as LilyPond, MuseScore, Finale, Sibelius and others.''
